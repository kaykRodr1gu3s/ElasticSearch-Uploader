when you create your API, you will get your credencials as a json, you will get something like this:



```json
{
  "id": "Your ID",
  "name": "my_demonstration_readme",
  "expiration": "Time to expire",
  "api_key": "Your API key",
  "encoded": "encoded",
  "beats_logstash_format": "beats_logstash"
}

I recommend that you save these datas in a .txt file or anywhere that you want, because you migth need this credencial sometimes.
